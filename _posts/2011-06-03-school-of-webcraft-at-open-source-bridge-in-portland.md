I'll be giving a talk on <a href="http://p2pu.org/webcraft">School of Webcraft</a> at <a href="http://osbridge.org">Open Source Bridge</a>. It's happening in Downtown Portland, Oregon at The Eliot Center on June 21 from 1:30PM to 2:15PM.

Mozilla and Peer 2 Peer University are creating the P2PU School of Webcraft, a new way to teach and learn web developer skills. Our classes are globally accessible, 100% free, and powered by learners, mentors and contributors like you. I'm going to cover the history of School of Webcraft, where we're going and how to get involved with the project.

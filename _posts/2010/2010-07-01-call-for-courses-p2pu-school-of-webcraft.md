<p><a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> and <a href="http://p2pu.org">Peer 2 Peer University</a> are creating the <a href="http://p2pu.org/webcraft">P2PU School of Webcraft</a>, the ultimate environment in which to learn the craft of open and standards-based web development.</p>

<p>This coming September we'll be launching our first cycle of six week courses including <em>Introduction to HTML5</em> and <em>Building Social with the Open Web</em>. We still have space for a few more courses, so whether you can teach a class for novice web developers, or run a workshop for web developers managing thousands of user accounts, we'd love to have you involved.</p>

<p>Following on the delivery model developed by P2PU, course organizers volunteer to take existing open learning materials or develop their own content and lead a group of peers through 6 weeks of online classes. Courses focus on project based learning in a peer environment and are proposed, created and led by members of the web development community &mdash; so the content will always be up to date with the latest technologies.</p>

<p>Over the next 18 months we'll be developing a new way of assessing and recognizing skills, hacker attitudes and knowledge that rewards project portfolios and realistic developer challenges, rather than hours spent cramming for a meaningless exam.</p>

<p>We'd love for you to become a part of this project and until July 18 we're inviting course proposals for P2PU School of Webcraft. We've made it really easy to get started, just fill out the proposal form, it takes less than 5 minutes!</p>

Next Saturday, 24 April 2010, I'll be at <a href="http://www.drumbeat.org/events/drumbeat-toronto">Drumbeat Toronto</a> to work on the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/Challenges/p2pu">P2PU Open Web Certificate</a>. If you're in or around Toronto, you should definitely come by.

Also keep your eyes peeled for an NYC Drumbeat event some time this summer.

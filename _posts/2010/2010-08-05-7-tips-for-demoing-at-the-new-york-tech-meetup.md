<p>Here are 7 Tips for demoing at the <a href="http://nytm.org">New York Tech Meetup</a>. This list is definitely not exhaustive, but it should help people out a bit. In the spirit of the advice I'm going to give, I'm going to get right to the tips.</p>

<strong>1. Intro in Under 30 Seconds</strong>
<p>No one cares who your partners are, they just want to see cool tech now.</p>

<strong>2. Always be Demoing</strong>
<p>This is the <em>most important</em> thing I can tell you. People don't give a damn about your Steve Jobs-esque Keynote deck, make sure everything you do shows off your product for real.</p>

<strong>3. Make the Crowd Do Something</strong>
<p>You want to avoid a distracted audience, the best way to do that is to have them do something that requires thinking and physical activity, even if it's just something small like raising a hand.</p>

<strong>4. Play Off the Crowd</strong>
<p>Sometimes things don't go as planned, take my little typo for example. Pay attention to the crowd and use their reactions to your advantage.</p>

<strong>5. Be Unexpected</strong>
<p>If the audience knows where you're going they may get bored. Also it's great to catch people off-guard and give them something to remember.</p>

<strong>6. Do Magic</strong>
<p>Literally. I have to thank <a href="http://www.daniellemorrill.com/">Danielle</a> for this tip because I tend to be a teacher. The crowd doesn't have to understand how things work to be amazed. The fact that they know it works is enough to get them to use your product.</p>

<strong>7. Have a Damn Good Product</strong>
<p>You're demoing to <em>The New York Tech Meetup</em>, your product better be good. If it's not, don't do a demo until it is. You've got more important things to do.</p>

<strong>Why You Should Care</strong>
<p>I gave a demo of <a href="http://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a> at the August 2010 NYTM and it went over pretty well. See my <a href="/post/2010/august/04/live_coding_demo_new_york_tech_meetup">summary blog post</a> for a video and recap.</p>

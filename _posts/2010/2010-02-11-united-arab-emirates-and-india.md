Today I'm taking off for a trip to the United Arab Emirates and India. I'm traveling with a good friend and we'll be [Couch Surfing](http://www.couchsurfing.org) the whole time. Last year I took a similar trip to go to [Education Without Borders](http://ewb2009.hct.ac.ae) in [Dubai](http://www.flickr.com/photos/johndbritton/sets/72157616511276242) followed by a short trip to [Mumbai](http://www.flickr.com/photos/johndbritton/sets/72157616511248962/). This year, there's no conference to attend and I'll be staying offline as much as possible. While I'm traveling I'll be thinking about things like the upcoming [NYC Creative Commons Salon](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20499) and [TEDxNYED](http://tedxnyed.com/) along with preparing to run my [Peer 2 Peer University](http://p2pu.org) course "[Mashing Up the Open Web](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/p2pu/Mashing_Up_The_Open_Web)".

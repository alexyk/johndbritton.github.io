Today I'm taking off for a trip to the United Arab Emirates and India. I'm traveling with a good friend and we'll be <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org">Couch Surfing</a> the whole time. Last year I took a similar trip to go to <a href="http://ewb2009.hct.ac.ae/">Education Without Borders</a> in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johndbritton/sets/72157616511276242/">Dubai</a> followed by a short trip to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johndbritton/sets/72157616511248962/">Mumbai</a>. This year, there's no conference to attend and I'll be staying offline as much as possible. While I'm traveling I'll be thinking about things like the upcoming <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20499">NYC Creative Commons Salon</a> and <a href="http://tedxnyed.com/">TEDxNYED</a> along with preparing to run my <a href="http://www.p2pu.org">Peer 2 Peer University</a> course '<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/p2pu/Mashing_Up_The_Open_Web">Mashing Up the Open Web</a>'.

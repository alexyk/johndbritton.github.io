<p>P2PU is going strong. We're getting ready to launch our third cycle of courses, but before we do that we need you to propose them! Join in on the fun, all the cool kids are doing it.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://blogs.p2pu.org/blog/2010/07/23/p2pu-call-for-courses/">P2PU Blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The  Peer 2 Peer University is gearing up to launch its third cycle of  courses this coming September, and we’re looking for new faces to join  the community. Do you have an idea for a six week course? Whether it’s  Physics 101 or Poker and Strategic Thinking, all ideas are welcome. You  can propose a course at <a href="http://wiki.p2pu.org/Create-a-Course">http://wiki.p2pu.org/Create-a-Course</a> (deadline  is August 6, 2010).</p> 

<p>If you’ve never designed or run a course before, that’s okay, too. P2PU is running a <a href="http://wiki.p2pu.org/orientation">Course Organizers Orientation</a> for newbies to introduce organizers  to the practice of online facilitation and provide support while they  build a new course. The orientation will be three weeks long and will  enable future course organizers to:</p> 

<ul> 
<li>Experience open social learning first-hand</li> 
<li>Distinguish peer-2-peer learning from formal online teaching</li> 
<li>Navigate the different features of the P2PU site</li> 
<li>Design a course on a topic of their choice on the P2PU site</li> 
<li>Learn how to use different synchronous/asynchronous platforms effectively</li> 
<li>Review and provide feedback for others; revise and refine syllabi for their course</li> 
</ul>

<p>Weekly  video conferences will be held to discuss important aspects of  community building, course design, finding and creating course content,  open educational resources (OER), and troubleshooting. Conferences will  be recorded and posted for those unable to attend. The orientation  leader will also post office hours to provide additional support.</p> 

<p>Building  on the feedback from participants and organizers in the last two cycles  of courses, the P2PU community realised that many potential course  organizers had reservations about some of the technological and  pedagogical aspects of running courses online. This orientation aims to  address these concerns, as well as help organizers become an active part  of the P2PU community.</p> 

<p>The  P2PU community consists of a diverse group of people. They are writers,  teachers, designers, doctoral and alternative grad students, artists,  copyright specialists, scientists, and blues guitar players. Above all,  they are learners–peers working together to learn from each other.</p> 

<p>More information, including how and where to sign up, can be found on the P2PU wiki:<a href="http://archive.p2pu.org/orientation"> </a><a href="http://wiki.p2pu.org/orientation">http://wiki.p2pu.org/orientation</a></p>

<p>You can submit course proposals until August 6, 2010.</p>

Some friends over at <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> tell me that they're launching a new grant program. The awards range from $1,000&mdash;$10,000. They're going to start distributing funds as early as August, so apply right away if you've got a good idea. I'm really psyched to see them making funding available to the general public like this. I've got a couple ideas of my own that might be eligible so be ready for some tough competition.

<strong>UPDATE: If you like the program, you should support it by <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">donating</a> today!</strong>

Here's the official announcement:
<blockquote>
We’re thrilled today to announce the launch of the Catalyst Campaign – from now through June 30, Creative Commons is raising money to fund our recently-launched <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Grants">Catalyst Grants</a> program.

Catalyst Grants will make it possible for individuals and organizations to harness the power of Creative Commons. A grant might enable a group in a developing country to research how Open Educational Resources can positively impact its community. Another could support a study of entrepreneurs using Creative Commons licenses to create a new class of socially responsible businesses. Anyone may apply for a Catalyst Grant, which ranges from $1,000-$10,000. 

<a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">But we can't do it without your help</a>. Our goal is to raise $100,000 from CC supporters like you to fund the grants that will make all this possible. Donate today to help spread our mission of openness and innovation across all cultural and national boundaries.

Thanks to the Milan Chamber of Commerce which has generously donated EUR 10,000 to jumpstart the effort!

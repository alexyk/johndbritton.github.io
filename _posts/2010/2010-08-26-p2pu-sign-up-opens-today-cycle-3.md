We just opened signups for the third cycle of courses at P2PU which are starting in September. This is our third, and largest cycle yet. We had 6 courses in the first, 16 in the second, and <strong>23 so far</strong> for the third cycle. I'm organizing a course called "<a href="http://bit.ly/c4AYU4">Web 200: The Anatomy of a Request</a>" as part of the School of Webcraft. Here's the story from the <a href="http://blogs.p2pu.org/blog/2010/08/26/sign-up-opens/">P2PU blog</a>:

<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://p2pu.org">Peer 2 Peer University</a> announced its third round of free and open online courses today, opening sign-ups for a growing list of courses dealing in su bject areas ranging from Collaborative Lesson Planning to Manifestations of Human Trafficking.</p>

<p>P2PU is also excited to announce the launch of the <a href="http://p2pu.org/p2pu-school-webcraft-september-2010-courses">P2PU School of Webcraft</a>, run in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/">Mozilla Foundation</a>. The School of Webcraft is a powerful new way to learn open, standards based web development in a collaborative environment. School of Webcraft courses include Beginning Python Webservices and HTML5.</p>

<p>All classes are globally accessible, free, and powered entirely by learners, mentors and contributors with the goal of creating  a vibrant, peer-led system that helps people around the world easy access to build careers on open web technology.</p>

<p>The P2PU community is growing and excited to have these new courses and their organizers on board.</p>

<p>Since the last round of courses, a few changes have taken place at P2PU, most noticeably on the P2PU site which has seen a major overhaul, and is simpler and easier to use than ever before. However, the nature of the P2PU community remains the same, and all community generated content is open and shareable under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a>.</p>

<p>The P2PU community consists of a diverse group of people. They are writers, teachers, designers, doctoral and alternative grad students, artists, copyright specialists, scientists, and blues guitar players. Above all, they are learnersâ€“peers working together to learn from each other.</p>

<p>Sign-ups for all courses are available at <a href="http://p2pu.org/course/list">http://p2pu.org/course/list</a>. Deadlines for sign-ups are 8th September 2010. The courses will run until October 27th. Each course application may require additional information.</p>

<a href="https://www.kiva.org/lender/johndbritton">I'm a Kiva lender</a>, and I believe you should be too. As promised in <a href="/post/2009/february/06/kiva_loans_change_lives">my previous post</a>, I present to you a second $25.00 Kiva gift certificate. 

The gift certificates are just special links you can follow that will give you $25.00 of credit in your new Kiva account to lend to the borrower of your choosing. The gift certificate is available to <em>whomever claims it first</em>.

<strong>Please don't claim the gift certificate if you're not new to Kiva, I'm hoping this will get someone new involved.</strong>

To claim the gift certificate <a href="http://www.kiva.org/redeem?purchaserEmail=public@johndbritton.com&giftCode=5242832482645">click this link</a> and follow the instructions to open a new account. Once you've created your account make sure to lend the funds to an entrepreneur, otherwise the money will just sit there for a year before becoming a donation to cover Kiva's operating costs.

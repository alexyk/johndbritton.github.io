Not too long ago <a href="http://gallery.johndbritton.com/v/2008/drupalcon_boston">I attended</a> <a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org">Drupalcon Boston</a>. While I was there I realized that as an internet professional I needed to revamp my online image. My <a href="/nostalgia">meek homepage</a> has remained fairly unchanged since 2005, serving only as a <a href="/contact">contact</a> reference. I've been working on quite a few projects that may be of interest to some of you, so keep an eye out here. I make no promise as to the frequency of updates but I will be sure to produce quality content when I do decide to share.

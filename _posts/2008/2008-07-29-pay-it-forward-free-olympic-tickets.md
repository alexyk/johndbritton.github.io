title: "Pay it Forward: Free Olympic Tickets"

<strong>UPDATE: This giveaway has ended, see <a href="http://www.johndbritton.com/post/2008/august/06/hong_kong_riding_high_pay_it_forward_winners">the results</a>.</strong>

I have a surplus of tickets to the Olympics; rather than scalp them for crazy prices I've decided to give them away free of charge. There are three pairs of tickets available (six tickets total).

The tickets are for Equestrian Events in Hong Kong (A Class) to take place on August 9, 2008. The events will be held at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha_Tin_Racecourse">Sha Tin Racecourse</a> (accessible via KCR).

You don't have to pay me back, but there is a slight catch. I expect you to "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_it_forward">pay it forward</a>" by doing a good deed, any good deed.

The tickets are available to anyone, really, anyone... that means you! All you have to do is leave a comment on this post describing the good deed you will do. Be creative, have fun and make sure the good deed is not directed toward me (that would defeat the idea of this pseudo-contest).

I will select three winners and three runners-up on August 6, 2008 and notify them via email. In the event that any of the winners is unable to attend or is unreachable by August 7, 2008 the tickets will be passed down to the runners-up.

Also, please be sure to give a valid email address (it won't be published) so I can contact you if you win.

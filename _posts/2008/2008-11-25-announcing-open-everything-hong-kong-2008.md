Over the past month and a half I've been organizing <a href="http://openeverything.hk/2008">Open Everything Hong Kong 2008</a>. Thanks to some help from <a href="http://www.currystar.com">Nick Wang</a> and the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/hongkong">Hong Kong Drupal User Group</a>, I've finally secured a venue and everything looks like it's in order. The guest list is growing fast, hope to see you there!

Open Everything (global site: http://openeverything.net) is a collection of events scattered all over the world, organized by ordinary people just like you. The purpose of the event is to explore and discuss 'open'. The interpretation of the idea is in the hands of attendees, and each event differs from the next.

Let there be no confusion, Open Everything is not a tech conference. There is much more to 'open' than technology, part of the goal of the event is to bring the less known aspects of 'open' to the attention of the general public.

At Open Everything Hong Kong 2008 there will be two invited guest speakers and four open sessions left in the hands of attendees. Feel free to come prepared with a topic to share, discuss, or present. Also feel free to act spontaneously and lead a group discussion with no preparation at all. The magic of the event is that it is open and we're all free to contribute as we desire.

The event is free and open to the public, we do kindly ask that you <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=pF3nGOxC38AHL77VKspOvDA&hl=en">register</a> so we can give you a fancy name badge and maybe even a T-shirt. We'd also like to know how many people to expect so that we're prepared.

Sister events will be held in <a href="http://openeverything.wik.is/Berlin">Berlin, Germany</a> and <a href="http://openeverything.wik.is/Madison,_WI">Madison, WI, USA</a> on the same day. We're expecting to have some sort of video link to hand over between timezones. Wish your city had an event? Join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/open-everything-discuss">discussion</a> and we'll be happy to help you organize an Open Everything of your very own ;).

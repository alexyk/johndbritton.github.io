This past Friday a few friends and I ventured in to New York City to see a live performance by CAKE (<a href="http://www.cakemusic.com/">Official Site</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake_(band)">Wikipedia</a>). It was everything I could have hoped for. Back during my freshman year at <a href="http://www.rpi.edu">RPI</a>, CAKE came to Albany and I've been kicking myself ever since I missed my chance to see them live.

The show was sold out, but I was able to snag a couple tickets off eBay. The crowd was good fun, I could tell there were tons of die-hard fans there. They played a good variety of tunes, but I was disappointed they didn't play "<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Cake/_/Mr.+Mastodon+Farm">Mr. Mastodon Farm</a>" even though I knew it was unlikely.

I streamed a few live videos of the show from my iPhone using the <a href="http://qik.com">Qik</a> application. <a href="/qik">Check them out</a>, and keep an eye out for my future live streams.

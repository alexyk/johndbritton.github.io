From the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Education/EduCourse/Announcement">Mozilla wiki</a>:
<blockquote>
Mozilla (in collaboration with ccLearn and the Peer 2 Peer University) launches a practical online seminar on open education. This six week course is targeted at educators who will gain basic skills in open licensing, open technology, and open pedagogy; work on prototypes of innovative open education projects; and get input from some of the world leading innovators along the way. 
</blockquote>

The most exciting part of this is that Mozilla is teaming up with the <a href="http://www.peer2peeruniversity.org">Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU)</a>, I guess this will be the first <em>official</em> course from the P2PU.

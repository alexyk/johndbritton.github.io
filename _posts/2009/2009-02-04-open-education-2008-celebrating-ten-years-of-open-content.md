<em>This post is long overdue (September 2008); I just found it sitting in my blog's queue. I had been trying to polish it off and must have forgotten about it, sorry for the delay.</em>

Thanks to the <a href="http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/552">generous support</a> of <a href="http://www.hewlett.org">The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation</a> I was able to travel from Hong Kong to <a href="http://gallery.johndbritton.com/v/2008/utah/logan/">Logan, UT</a> for the <a href="http://cosl.usu.edu/events/opened2008/">Open Education 2008</a> conference.

I started off the trip with a <a href="http://gallery.johndbritton.com/v/2008/south_korea/seoul">layover in Seoul</a> that I extended for a couple of days. While I was there I saw a Korea vs. Japan football match, went to the <a href="http://www.openpan.com/">Korea Traditional Performing Arts Festival</a>, and ate a live octopus. Suffice it to say that South Korea was an adventure of it's own.

I flew into <a href="http://gallery.johndbritton.com/v/2008/utah/salt_lake_city/">Salt Lake City, UT</a> where I was met by my amazing <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.com">Couch Surfing</a> host <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.com/people/incogitatus">Anthony</a>. He chauffeured me from SLC airport to his place in Logan. For the next three days I sat in on a ton of sessions, met great people, and shared my ideas for what I was calling "uOpenEd".

If you read my application to OpenEd 2008 (linked below), you'll see my reasons for attending and my goals for "uOpenEd". Apparently, I wasn't the only one who had these kinds of thoughts and on the final day of the conference, I sat in on a session entitled "The <a href="http://www.peer2peeruniversity.org">Peer 2 Peer University</a>: Moving Forward". This session was different from all the rest. Rather than someone delivering a lecture, we had a brief intro and broke off into groups to discuss and solve problems. That was the icing on the cake, it was exactly what I was looking for, a team to work with to turn the idea into a reality.

The P2PU session was lead by <a href="http://bokaap.net/">Philipp Schmidt</a> & <a href="http://reganmian.net">Stian Haklev</a>. Coincidentally, I had been emailing back and fourth with Philipp about <a href="http://openeverything.net">Open Everything</a> before the conference, and had no idea that we'd bump into each other (and end up working on the P2PU project together).

As per Stian's suggestion, I've posted my OpenEd 2008 <a href="/files/OpenEd 2008 Scholarship Application - John Britton.pdf">Scholarship Application</a> along with the <a href="/files/Open Education 2008 Conference Proceedings.zip">Conference Proceedings, 86MB (zip)</a>.

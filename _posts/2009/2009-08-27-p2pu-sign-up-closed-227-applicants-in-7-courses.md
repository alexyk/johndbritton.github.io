On August 26, 2009 at midnight EST we closed applications to the first cycle at the <a href="http://p2pu.org">Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU)</a> with a total of 227 applicants across 7 courses. The six week pilot phase will begin on September 9, 2009 (09/09/09). Each of the 7 courses has a maximum enrollment of 8 - 15 students. All applicants will be notified of their status within a week.

<h3>Summary</h3>
These are exciting times, all of our initial courses have more applicants than we can possibly accept. At the end of the first cycle, we're going to meet for a retrospective and iterate on our methodology. During the second cycle I'll be leading a course on web development. Hope to see you there.

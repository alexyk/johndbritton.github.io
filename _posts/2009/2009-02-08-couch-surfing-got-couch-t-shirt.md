Back when <a href="/post/2008/june/21/international_couch_surfing_day_2008_beijing_china">I was in Beijing</a>, <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.com/people/alainsojourner">Alain</a> sent me a really cool design for a Couch Surfing T-Shirt. I'm not really sure who did the design, but I really love it. My plan was to print it and give them out to my surfers, but I just haven't gotten around to that yet.

With <a href="http://www.couchcrashfestival.com/">Couch Crash NYC</a> coming up in just a couple weeks, I thought it'd be a perfect time to get some made. If you'll be at Couch Crash NYC and want a T-shirt, just leave a comment on this post with your shirt size. Also please fill in your real email address on the comment form (it won't be published) so I can get in touch with you if necessary.

I don't know what the cost of the shirts will be yet, but there will be <strong>NO PRICE MARKUP</strong>, you just pay the cost of the printed shirt.

Also, please feel free to download, modify the design and to print your own shirts and share them with others.

I'm planning to print them on a light brown "ringer" tee, with dark brown trim.

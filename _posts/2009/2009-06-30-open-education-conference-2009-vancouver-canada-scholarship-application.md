<em>This blog post is my application for a travel scholarship to attend <a href="http://openedconference.org/archives/324">OpenEd 2009</a>.</em>

Last year I <a href="/post/2009/february/04/open_education_2008_celebrating_ten_years_open_content">applied</a> for, and was awarded a scholarship to attend OpenEd in Logan, Utah. I came all the way from Hong Kong, and I'm tremendously glad that I did. My experience at OpenEd has made an enormous impact on my life. I met <a href="http://www.haishuolee.com/">some</a> <a href="http://reganmian.net">great</a> <a href="http://bokaap.net">people</a>, found a great <a href="http://peer2peeruniversity.org">project</a>, and subsequently landed an excellent <a href="http://www.flatworldknowledge.com">job</a> in Open Education.

There are four main reasons I plan to attend OpenEd 2009:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.peer2peeruniversity.org">P2PU</a> - Most (if not all) the people from the Peer2Peer University will be there, it's a perfect time to meet up and move forward.</a>
<li><a href="http://openeverything.net">Open Everything</a> - I'm facilitating the organization of Open Everything unconferences in more than 10 cities around the world. OpenEd will be a great place to find more people to get involved. <a href="http://nyc.openeverything.us">Open Everything NYC</a> featured an entire Open Education track.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flatworldknowledge.com">Flat World Knowledge</a> - I've recently taken a position at this innovative Open textbook publishing company. I'll be there to share and answer questions.</li>
<li>Open Sessions - I thrive on Open sessions. I'm sure I'll lead at least one, and will be active in many.</li>
</ol>

There are plenty more good reasons for me to be there, who knows what new things I'll discover.

The most important issue I'm currently facing relates to the commercialization of the Open Education field. If I'm selected to attend OpenEd 2009, I'll be there to gather information and discuss the topic of for-profit commercialization of Open Education. Important decisions lie ahead and I want to be sure to do the right thing. It will be valuable to interact with people who have experience in commercializing Open and building sustainable business models.

Thanks for reading, feel free to <a href="/contact">contact</a> me. I appreciate your consideration for this opportunity and I hope to see you all at OpenEd 2009.

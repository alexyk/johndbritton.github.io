I just came across <a href="http://devel2.njit.edu/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1282-Open-Everything-Goes-Global.html">this post</a> by <a href="http://ronkowitz.com">Kenneth Ronkowitz</a> about the term "Open Everything". It seems he's been using the term <a href="http://devel2.njit.edu/serendipity/index.php?/categories/38-Open-Everything">on his blog</a> since the beginning of 2008. He managed to find his way from the (now deleted) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_everything">Wikipedia article</a>, to the <a href="http://openeverything.net">Open Everything Wiki</a>, to the <a href="http://openeverything.hk">Open Everything Hong Kong</a> website all the way back to my blog. The interesting part was that he was able to connect me with <a href="http://www.peer2peeruniversity.org">P2PU</a> and some other topics he'd been blogging about recently. The internet is getting smaller, I swear.

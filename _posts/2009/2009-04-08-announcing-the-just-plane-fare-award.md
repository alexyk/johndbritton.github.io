I'd like to officially announce the <a href="/just_plane_fare_award">Just Plane Fare Award</a>. I'm now accepting applications from <a href=""http://www.bhrsd.org/mmrhs/mmhome/m_index.htm">MMRHS</a> students planning international travel during the summer of 2009. One winner will receive free round trip airfare to anywhere in the world to go and <strong>do</strong> <em>something</em>.

Why? Because I can. Because the students deserve it. Because others have done for me. Pay it forward.

Partially inspired by <a href="http://jaggi.name/">Sidharth</a> (... Ben, Prashant, Neha & Co.) from <a href="http://www.lifeunlimited.org.in/">Life Unlimited</a>.

Read the <a href="/just_plane_fare_award">full details</a> for eligibility and restrictions.

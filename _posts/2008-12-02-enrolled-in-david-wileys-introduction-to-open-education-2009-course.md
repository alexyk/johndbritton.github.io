I've just signed up for <a href="http://opencontent.org/blog">David Wiley</a>'s <a href="http://opencontent.org/wiki/index.php?title=Introduction_to_Open_Education_2009">Introduction to Open Education 2009</a> course that is being offered at <a href="http://www.byu.edu">Brigham Young University</a> during the upcoming term. I'm not a student at BYU, but "the course will be open again this year, meaning anyone, anywhere is welcome to participate. And yes, [David] will print and mail completion certificates again for those who earn and want them."

The experience will help me get a feel for online learning environments and hopefully give some inspiration for my work on the <a href="http://peer2peeruniversity.org">Peer2Peer University (P2PU)</a>.

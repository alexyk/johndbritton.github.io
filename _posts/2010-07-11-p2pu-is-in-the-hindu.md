P2PU just got coverage in <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/article509669.ece">The Hindu</a>, which, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Hindu&oldid=370224129">Wikipedia</a> "is the second-largest circulated daily English newspaper in India." The author, Ajai Sreevatsan, quoted me and mentioned my course "Mashing Up the Open Web."

<blockquote>
<strong>Video discussions</strong>

John Britton, course organiser of 'Mashing up the Open Web,' says time zones are a problem while attempting to simulate a "sit around the fire and learn by discussion" environment virtually. "But lively weekly video discussions (using a combination of Skype and IRC) to review materials and work through the questions presented by the peers still happen."

The 'class' is very diverse, he says. "We have peers from Korea, Japan, India, Spain, the U.S. and Canada. They're artists, technologists, environmentalists, and traditional students."

[![Open Source Bridge Badge](http://opensourcebridge.org/badges/2011/speak125.png)](http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/62)

I'll be giving a talk on [School of Webcraft](http://p2pu.org/webcraft) at [Open Source Bridge](http://osbridge.org). It's happening in Downtown Portland, Oregon at The Eliot Center on June 21 from 1:30PM to 2:15PM.

Mozilla and Peer 2 Peer University are creating the P2PU School of Webcraft, a new way to teach and learn web developer skills. Our classes are globally accessible, 100% free, and powered by learners, mentors and contributors like you. I'm going to cover the history of School of Webcraft, where we're going and how to get involved with the project.

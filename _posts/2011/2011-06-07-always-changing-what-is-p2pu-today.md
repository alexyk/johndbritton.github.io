Someone asked me to explain [P2PU](http://p2pu.org) and 
[School of Webcraft](http://p2pu.org/webcraft) in an email. My description 
is always changing, this is what I came up with today:

> P2PU is a community for learning about anything with peers. Right now we're 
> focused on online learning groups (courses, study groups, book clubs, etc) 
> but are definitely keen on facilitating communities in the real world. We're 
> breaking the traditional model of top down (teachers / students) learning and 
> making it simple to learn from each other. Aside from making learning from 
> peers easy, we want to help members track and share their progress as well as 
> motivate them to continue. We're even working on new forms of acknowledging 
> skills. For the School of Webcraft we've partnered with Mozilla, a leader in 
> web technology, to map web developer skills and provide competency based 
> assessment. School of Webcraft is the first partnership of many that will 
> leverage industry based brand recognition and trust to give value to 
> credentials earned from peers at P2PU.

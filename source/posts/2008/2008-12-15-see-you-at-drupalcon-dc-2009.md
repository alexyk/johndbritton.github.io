I'm going to <a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org">Drupalcon DC 2009</a>! I managed to get my ticket at the early-bird price of $125, tickets are now $250 each.

I'm really looking forward to the trip. I've been to the capital of at least twenty other countries, but I've never actually seen <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Washington_(D.C.)">Washington, DC</a>. This will be a great opportunity for me to see my nation's capital city.

I'm planning to co-host a BoF session entitled "<a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/node/2082">Guilt in Open Source Projects</a>" with <a href="http://chickenandegg.ca">Dave</a> from <a href="http://advomatic.com">Advomatic</a>. The session is a spin-off of a session I led at <a href="http://openeverything.hk/2008">Open Everything Hong Kong</a>, "<a href="http://openeverything.wik.is/Hong_Kong/2008_Event_Wiki/Open_Sessions/Guilt_in_Open_Organizations">Guilt in Open Organizations</a>".

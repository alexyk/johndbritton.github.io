If you've got ten minutes to spare, I suggest you check out the [presentation](http://tr.im/Mqg9) that I just gave about the soon to be 'Open Web Career Track' at the Peer 2 Peer University. The Open Web Career Track is one of the first few [Drumbeat](http://drumbeat.org) projects being kickstarted in collaboration with [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org).

The [Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU)](http://p2pu.org) is an online community of open study groups for short university-level courses. Think of it as online book clubs for open educational resources. The P2PU helps you navigate the wealth of open education materials that are out there, creates small groups of motivated learners, and supports the design and facilitation of courses. Students and tutors get recognition for their work, and we are building pathways to formal credit as well.

P2PU is entirely volunteer driven, open, and free of charge. Anyone can lead a course about anything, and starting on 12 February we'll be accepting applications to participate in each of the 15 courses slated to start in March. Keep a lookout on <http://www.p2pu.org> for more information on how to participate.

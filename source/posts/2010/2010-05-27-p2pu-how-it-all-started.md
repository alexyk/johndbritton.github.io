<p>A few years ago, I had an idea: I wanted to travel around the world and meet interesting people who I could learn from in exchange for sharing my skills. I remember having the idea very vividly. I was on an airplane, as I <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/johndbritton">often</a> was back in those days, and I was scribbling as fast as I could in my notebook. There was going to be an online component to a mostly offline experience. People would be able to lend resources such as classrooms, domain knowledge, books, supplies, and equipment. I was convinced something like this should already exist, so I did what you'd expect, I scoured the net high and low. As I searched I came across a number of different communities and resources but couldn't find exactly what I was looking for.</p>

<p>Sure there was <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org">CouchSurfing</a>, but that was mainly focused on the travel community with a very minor attempt at a skill sharing system. I also found things like <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/">MIT's Open Course Ware</a>, but there was something lacking, the community, <strong>the people</strong>. In my searching I came across a new term, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_education">Open Education</a>. I had long known of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOSS">FLOSS</a>, so the concept of open education was pretty natural to me. Further down the road I heard about the annual <a href="http://openedconference.org">Open Education Conference</a>, so in 2008, I <a href="/post/2009/february/04/open_education_2008_celebrating_ten_years_open_content">attended</a>. My trip was kindly funded by the <a href="http://hewlett.org">William &amp; Flora Hewlett Foundation</a> based on my intent to share the idea. As it turned out, I wasn't alone in my thinking and I met <a href="http://bokaap.net">Philipp</a>, <a href="http://reganmian.net/">Stian</a>, and <a href="http://cnx.org/member_profile/thierstj">Joel</a>.</p>

<p>At this point, tons of ideas were brewing for all of us. There were a million directions that we could go. Different people had different ideas and we took a slow growth route in order to solidify what it was we were trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>Fast forward two years and you've got <a href="http://p2pu.org">Peer 2 Peer University</a>, a thriving community of individuals passionate about learning. Our <a href="http://p2pu.org/values">core values</a> are clear. We're an open community for peer learning. We're here to facilitate learning groups and give participants the recognition they deserve. P2PU encourages experimentation, and I love experiments.</p>

<p>As of now we've run more than twenty <a href="http://p2pu.org/courses">courses</a> in two cycles. In the most recent cycle, I organized my first course, <a href="http://p2pu.org/mashing-open-web-mar-2010">Mashing Up the Open Web</a>. Mashing up The Open Web is the first course in a <a href="http://www.drumbeat.org/project/p2p-university-open-web-career-track">series of Open Web courses</a> that we're working on in conjunction with <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> as part of the <a href="http://www.drumbeat.org">Drumbeat</a> initiative. I'll save the details for a later post, but I will say that the course was an amazing success and that I absolutely enjoyed every minute of it. I've always had the idea of becoming a teacher in the back of my mind, P2PU has helped me prove that idea is a good one.</p>

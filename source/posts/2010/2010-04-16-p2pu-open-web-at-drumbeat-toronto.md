Next Saturday, 24 April 2010, I'll be at [Drumbeat Toronto](http://www.drumbeat.org/events/drumbeat-toronto) to work on the [P2PU Open Web Certificate](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/Challenges/p2pu). If you're in or around Toronto, you should definitely come by.

Also keep your eyes peeled for an NYC Drumbeat event some time this summer.

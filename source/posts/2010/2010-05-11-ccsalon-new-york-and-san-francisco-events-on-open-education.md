It's been a busy couple of months working with <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a>. Back in March, Jane Park and I organized <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20499">ccSalon New York</a> and exactly one month later I was lucky enough to attend <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/21691">ccSalon San Francisco</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>CC Salons are global, informal events focused on building a community of artists, developers, and creators of all kinds around Creative Commons licenses, standards, and technology. The first event took place in San Francisco in 2006 with the idea to replicate in other locations internationally. Since then salons have sprung up in cities around the world. Whether you're familiar with Creative Commons or are brand new to the concepts behind it, we encourage you to check out a salon near you.</p>

<p>The format for each event varies based on the location, but the overall concept is simple. CC Salons are open forums for people who are interested in the issues surrounding Creative Commons and global participatory culture. If you're interested in attending - check out the upcoming salons. If your city doesn't have one - feel free to start your own. Check out the resources for starting your salon for extra info.</p>

Both <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Salon">salons</a> were focused on Open Education, an area that I am very passionate about. I've spent the last two years focused on the intersection of technology and open education. Here are some of the highlights from each of the events:

Both of these ccSalons were great venues to meet newcomers and reconnect with people I've met in the past. I was especially excited P2PU and Flat World Knowledge represented by multiple parties at both events. I even got to meet Tanushree, one of the Peers from 'Mashing Up the Open Web'. <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Salon#Resources_for_starting_your_own_CC_Salon">Organize</a> a ccSalon in your city!

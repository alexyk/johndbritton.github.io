    <h1>Consciously Deciding to Learn</h1>
  </div>
  <div id="post-body">
    <h1 id='dropping_out_of_college'>Dropping Out of College</h1>

<p>I dropped out of college about two and a half years ago, but that has not been an excuse to stop learning. In fact, I&#8217;ve put more effort into learning on my own than I ever did while I was in the system. School was very much about external validation, I lived for taking top marks with as little effort as possible. It wasn&#8217;t really about learning, it was about jumping through hoops to prove myself to the world.</p>

<p>Many factors contributed to my decision to stop pursuing a degree, but the biggest was that school got in the way of life. I had two options: continue to coast through courses with as little effort as possible or get out of the game and start living life. I chose life.</p>

<p>I had just come back to the country from living in China. I only had one year of school remaining, but even that was too much. The &#8220;back to school&#8221; motivation wore off pretty quickly and at just about the same time I landed a web developer gig at <a href='http://flatworldknowledge.com'>Flat World Knowledge</a>. There I was, gainfully employed but still attending a <a href='http://rpi.edu'>$50k+/year institution</a>. It didn&#8217;t make any sense.</p>

<p>School became unnecessary, so I left. I packed up my things and moved in with a friend near my new job and eventually made my way to New York City. At the time, it was a difficult decision. I was the first in my family to ever make it to college, and I was set to be the first to graduate. Looking back, leaving school was definitely the right decision for me. I left because it was getting in the way of <strong>doing</strong> important things and I couldn&#8217;t hold back any longer.</p>

<h1 id='its_not_the_only_way'>It&#8217;s Not the Only Way</h1>

<p>All that to say, school isn&#8217;t necessary for learning. It can be great, especially when you don&#8217;t know exactly what you want. Many interesting, helpful, and incredibly intelligent people are part of the system. Without a doubt, joining them is a good way learn but it&#8217;s not the only way.</p>

<p>I spend a good portion of every day learning. I try to understand how things work. I secretly perform psychology experiments on my friends. I read as much as I can. I practice multiple languages. I dabble in the arts even though I&#8217;ve always been right-brained.</p>

<p>With my recent move to Warsaw, I got to do some personal housekeeping. I got rid of lots of stuff that I don&#8217;t need, I removed myself from the daily grind of the city, and I cleared my entire schedule. Slowly, I&#8217;m adding things back in and I&#8217;ve been very conscious of what is deserving of my time. Learning is definitely priority one for me these days.</p>

<h1 id='things_im_consciously_learning'>Things I&#8217;m Consciously Learning</h1>

<p>The hardest part of self directed learning has been deciding what I want to learn and what activities to spend my time on regularly. These are the topics I&#8217;m focused on and what I&#8217;m doing to learn them.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reading</strong> - Pretty standard, lots of books on my Kindle. I prefer to read entire books in a single sitting. Not a very directed activity.</li>

<li><strong>Coding</strong> - Building small projects in a short period of time. <a href='http://48hourapps.com'>Going from idea to shipped in two days</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Design</strong> - This goes hand in hand with coding, I want my projects to look good when I ship them.</li>

<li><strong>Spanish</strong> - Whenever possible I do language exchanges through Meetup and CouchSurfing to keep my Spanish skills sharp.</li>

<li><strong>Polish</strong> - Living in Warsaw I practice all the time. I spend a few hours a week studying new vocabulary and grammar using Rosetta Stone and I&#8217;m enrolled in a course at the University of Warsaw. The course isn&#8217;t for a certificate, just for some people to practice with.</li>

<li><strong>Poetry</strong> - This is out of my comfort zone, which I think is important. I joined &#8221;<a href='http://p2pu.org/en/groups/breaking-the-rules-a-poetry-workshop/'>Breaking the Rules: a Poetry Workshop</a>&#8221; at P2PU. &#8220;Five weeks. Five poems. We&#8217;ll look at what makes them tick, and write our own versions.&#8221; I&#8217;m also getting insight into how people use the site.</li>

<li><strong>Music</strong> - I&#8217;ve got a <a href='http://monome.org'>Monome</a> and some crazy software and I&#8217;m experimenting with to make my own music. My goal is to perform something live for friends eventually. I don&#8217;t practice often, but when I do I binge for many hours.</li>

<li><strong>Business</strong> - AVC / MBA Mondays - I read AVC daily, and try to get involved with the community there when appropriate. I&#8217;m using DailyLit to get back issues of all the posts delivered to my inbox three days per week.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id='teaching_is_learning'>Teaching is Learning</h1>

<p>In addition to all that, I&#8217;ve taken on three &#8220;students&#8221; of my own. I&#8217;m giving free English classes to two Korean&#8217;s in Warsaw and I&#8217;m teaching a Polish guy about web programming. Helping other people learn is really enjoyable, they&#8217;re really happy to get help and being responsible forces me to understand things fully before trying to explaining them.</p>

<h1 id='what_are_you_learning'>What are you learning?</h1>

<p>Learn anything with your peers at <a href='http://p2pu.org'>P2PU</a>.</p>
